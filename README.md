# System F implementation
Academic System F implementation in Haskell, based on the Types and Programming Languages book by B. C. Pierce.

## Dependencies
On some platforms, testpack or QuickCheck has to be installed (for exception assertions) as well.
On other platforms, this is already part of HUnit.

## Usage:
1. Start ghci through terminal
2. Load the source file: :l systemf.hs
3. Run the tests: run
